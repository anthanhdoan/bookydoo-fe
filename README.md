My first venture into VueJS.

A todo app and bookmark manager in one, to be used as your homepage for productivity purposes.

Backlog:

- ~~Create a basic todo app without persistent storage~~
- Refactor into smaller components with props
- Add a description and parameter based routing to an edit page
- Add support for local storage
- Create a basic bookmark manager app
